## Appendix C - AWS CLI Environment Notes

Creating a AWS Cli environment.
In this lab, we need to create a cli environment for GameLift binary upload.
Fortunately, we can easily create a AWS CLI environment following below steps.

For installing on each OS, refer to this page: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html

Once you have the environment installed, you will need to create a IAM user with programmatic access, and setup your command line interface with the created IAM credentials.
Please refer to this page for detailed instructions:
